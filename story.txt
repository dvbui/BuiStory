One day I said
I'm really going to marry
Really going to marry
Really going to marry
Really going to marry

One day I said
I'm really going to marry
My mother

"If it were death to love,

I should have died - 

And died again

One thousand times over."

~~Quoted from 「Manyoshu」, written by Otomo no Yakamochi~~

I read these lines aloud to the crowd standing before me.
I was nervous but their cheers bring me joy.
I choose the right poems to share.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are many ways to say I love you.
You'll find many ways to understand what love is.
Many ways, many ways, many ways to say
I love you.
