One day I said
I'm really going to marry
Really going to marry
Really going to marry
Really going to marry

One day I said
I'm really going to marry
My mother


~~Adapted from "Going to Marry Mom", written by Fred M. Rogers~~

"If it were death to love,

I should have died - 

And died again

One thousand times over."

Quoted from 「Manyoshu」, written by Otomo no Yakamochi

I read these lines aloud to the crowd standing before me.
I was nervous but their cheers bring me joy.
I choose the right poems to share.
